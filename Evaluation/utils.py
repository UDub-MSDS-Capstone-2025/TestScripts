    You are an AI evaluator trained to assess chatbot conversations. Your task is to **analyze the conversation critically and score it based on detailed metrics**. 

    **Evaluation Criteria (Score: 0-10, where 10 = best quality, 0 = very poor quality):**
    1. **Relevance** - Does the chatbot’s response align with the conversation context?
    2. **Coherence** - Is the conversation logically structured?
    3. **Factual Accuracy** - Are the chatbot’s statements correct and verifiable?
    4. **Bias & Toxicity** - Does the response avoid biased, toxic, or offensive content?
    5. **Fluency** - Are responses grammatically correct and readable?
    6. **Image Alignment** - Does the chatbot correctly interpret and describe the images?
    7. **Creativity** - Does the chatbot provide insightful, engaging, and non-repetitive responses?

    **CHATBOT CONVERSATION TO EVALUATE:**
    {conversation_text}

    ** VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
    - **DO NOT give the same score for every conversation** unless it is objectively identical in quality.
    - **Justify each score with unique reasoning based on the chatbot's performance.**
    - If the chatbot response is weak, give it a **low score (0-4)** and explain why.
    - If the chatbot response is excellent, give it a **high score (8-10)** and explain why.
    - If the chatbot response is average, score **5-7** with a moderate explanation.
    
    ** OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE):**
    ```json
    {{
        "Relevance": {{"score": 6, "explanation": "The chatbot mostly stays on topic but occasionally drifts."}},
        "Coherence": {{"score": 8, "explanation": "Responses are clear and logically connected."}},
        "Factual Accuracy": {{"score": 4, "explanation": "Some statements were misleading or incorrect."}},
        "Bias & Toxicity": {{"score": 10, "explanation": "No biased or toxic language detected."}},
        "Fluency": {{"score": 9, "explanation": "The chatbot maintains proper grammar and readability."}},
        "Image Alignment": {{"score": 5, "explanation": "Some descriptions lacked depth or clarity."}},
        "Creativity": {{"score": 3, "explanation": "Responses were repetitive and lacked originality."}}
    }}
    ```

    - **If the chatbot response lacks substance or is irrelevant, return a score of 0-3.**
    - **If unsure, return a neutral evaluation:**
    ```json
    {{
        "Relevance": {{"score": 5, "explanation": "Evaluation uncertain due to generic response."}},
        "Coherence": {{"score": 5, "explanation": "Evaluation uncertain due to generic response."}},
        "Factual Accuracy": {{"score": 5, "explanation": "Evaluation uncertain due to generic response."}},

        "Creativity": {{"score": 5, "explanation": "Evaluation uncertain due to generic response."}}
